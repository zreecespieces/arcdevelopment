                  In 2013, Facebook invented a new way of building websites.
                  This new system, React.js, completely revolutionizes the
                  process and practice of website development.
                </p>
                <p className={classes.paragraphMain}>
                  Instead of chaining together long individual pages, like
                  traditional websites, React websites are built with little
                  chunks of code called components. These components are faster,
                  easier to maintain, and are easily reused and customized, each
                  serving a singular purpose.
                </p>
                <p className={classes.paragraphMain}>
                  Two years later they shocked the world by releasing a similar
                  system, React Native, for producing iOS and Android apps.
                  Instead of having to master two completely separate
                  development platforms, you can leverage the knowledge you
                  already possessed from building websites and reapply it
                  directly! This was a huge leap forward.
                </p>
                <p className={classes.paragraphMain}>
                  This technology is now being used by companies like AirBnB,
                  Microsoft, Netflix, Pinterest, Skype, Tesla, UberEats, and
                  when Facebook purchased Instagram large portions of it were
                  even rebuilt using React.
                </p>
                <p className={classes.paragraphMain}>
                  Developers have since built on top of these systems by
                  automating project setup and deployment, allowing creators to
                  focus as much as possible on their work itself.
                </p>
                <p className={classes.paragraphMain}>
                  These technical advancements translate into savings by
                  significantly reducing the workload and streamlining the
                  workflow for developing new pieces of software, while also
                  lowering the barrier to entry for mobile app development.

            <p className={classes.paragraphSmallBuild}>
              Engineering begins after your approval on the final designs. We
              start by scaffolding out the project at a high level, prioritizing
              some areas over others.
            </p>
            <p className={classes.paragraphSmallBuild}>
              Each area is then developed in order of importance until ready to
              be connected to the next piece.
            </p>
            <p className={classes.paragraphSmallBuild}>
              Typically the backend, behind the scenes operations, are completed
              first. Once all the services are in place we can then create the
              front end, user side of things.
            </p>
            <p className={classes.paragraphSmallBuild}>
              Finishing the application doesnâ€™t mean weâ€™re done though, because
              we use extensive testing to guarantee compatibility with all
              intended devices.
            </p>
            <p className={classes.paragraphSmallBuild}>
              Only after our rigorous examinations will we accept a product as
              finished, then pushing it through the production pipeline. This
              produces an optimized, compressed, consumer version of the code
              and assets ready for deployment.

              From there on out we make sure your application is kept up to date

              When new developments arise or new techniques are discovered in
              future projects, we will implement those advancements in your
              project as part of our routine maintenance.

              By planning for future features and changes, we can build and

              Our iterative process will keep you current and competitive,
